# Predict-House-Prices-with-Multivariable-Linear-Regression
I build a tool which can predict the current valuation of House in Boston. While predicting value I took scale factors into account like inflation rate, dollars price. I use Boston house price data set from Scikit-learn to build this tool. I use Python for data analysis and model building.
